 # Melanoma Detection via Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
> The objective of this project is to create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify a dermoscopic image of a skin lesion in 9 different classes. A dermoscopic image is a picture of the skin using a microscope and illumination.

## General Information
- Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- The data set contains 2357 images of the following diseases:
    * Actinic keratosis
    * Basal cell carcinoma
    * Dermatofibroma
    * Melanoma
    * Nevus
    * Pigmented benign keratosis
    * Seborrheic keratosis
    * Squamous cell carcinoma
    * Vascular lesion

## Conclusions
- It was difficult to achieve high accuracy in this project. Mainly due to heavy processing power requirement.
- Thought the training module was able to reach acceptable range of accuracy, validation on test data set was not optimum.
- Image augmentation helps in improving the accuracy of the model and generalizing it.
- Droppouts can heavily affect the model and optimize it, in case of overfitting.
